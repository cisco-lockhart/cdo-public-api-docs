# Cisco Defense Orchestrator Public API Documentation

Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO) exposes a rich REST API. Internal and external users can leverage the API to programmatically integrate with the product. This document describes the semantics of the REST API. The public API exposes a curated subset of features available across multiple CDO internal REST APIs. Backwards compatibility of the public API is guaranteed using a versioning system.
