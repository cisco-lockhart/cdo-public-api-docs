## Example

```python
from cdo_sdk_python.models.memory_health_metrics import MemoryHealthMetrics

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of MemoryHealthMetrics from a JSON string
memory_health_metrics_instance = MemoryHealthMetrics.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(MemoryHealthMetrics.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
memory_health_metrics_dict = memory_health_metrics_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of MemoryHealthMetrics from a dict
memory_health_metrics_form_dict = memory_health_metrics.from_dict(memory_health_metrics_dict)
