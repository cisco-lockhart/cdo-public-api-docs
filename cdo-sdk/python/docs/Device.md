## Example

```python
from cdo_sdk_python.models.device import Device

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Device from a JSON string
device_instance = Device.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Device.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
device_dict = device_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Device from a dict
device_form_dict = device.from_dict(device_dict)
