# Welcome to the CDO Public API Documentation

These docs are published to DevNet using PubHub.

# Adding / Modifying

To get the latest OpenAPI YAML from Staging into Pubhub, run:
```
scripts/cli download --apimatic-api-token <token>
```

This script will transform the API documentation in [the Staging Public API](https://edge.staging.cdo.cisco.com/api/platform/public-api/v3/api-docs), transform it into a format that PubHub likes using APImatic, make a commit in this repository, and push the commit to PubHub. 

> You can generate an APImatic API token for yourself by creating a free account at [https://apimatic.io] and creating an authentication key following the instructions in the [APImatic documentation](https://docs.apimatic.io/account-management/obtaining-auth-keys/).

## Why APImatic?

Pubhub does not like the OpenAPI YAML and JSON files generated by SpringDoc for reasons I am unable to debug (because there are no debug logs in Pubhub). So what we are doing here is feeding the OpenAPI JSON file generated by the CDO public API into APImatic, and transforming it to a YAML file that Pubhub likes.

Hat-tip to Oleksii Borysenko for suggesting APImatic.
