# Version 0.1.0 (2023-04-02)

## Added

This is the first major release of the CDO API, and exposes a large number of CDO features. Some of the highlights include:
- Simplified Inventory management: API endpoints to add, delete, view, and perform operations on devices, device managers, and cloud services available on the CDO inventory page.
- Integrated cdFMC/CDO APIs: The cdFMC REST APIs can be used using the same URL as the CDO's APIs.
- User and tenant management: API endpoints to view tenant information, and add, remove, and modify user roles using the CDO API.
- Change log Monitoring: API endpoints that can be used to see who has been making changes to devices, and to manage change requests.
- Object Management: Add, edit, delete, and view objects in CDO using these API endpoints.
