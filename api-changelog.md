# Version 1.13.0 (2025-05-23)

## Added

- New endpoint to [deploy changes to up to 50 FTDs simultaneously](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cisco-security-cloud-control/cdfmc-managed-ftds-only-deploy-changes-to-multiple-ftd-devices/).

## Improvements

- You can now upgrade up to 50 FTDs simultaneously using
  the [Upgrade multiple FTD devices](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cisco-security-cloud-control/upgrade-multiple-ftd-devices/)
  endpoint.
- It is now possible to store arbitrary metadata in a device record on SCC Firewall Manager. This
  metadata is not used by the API, but can be used by other applications to store information
  related to the device.

# Version 1.12.0 (2025-05-06)

## Added

- Endpoint
  to [rebuild cache for cdFMC upgrade packages](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cisco-security-cloud-control/update-cache-of-compatible-upgrade-packages-for-all-ftds/)
  on a tenant.

## Added

- Endpoint
  to [upgrade multiple (up to 10) FTDs simultaneously](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cisco-security-cloud-control/upgrade-multiple-ftd-devices/)

  to [read configuration from multiple ASAs](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cisco-security-cloud-control/read-configurations-for-multiple-asa-devices/)
  into SCC Firewall Manager.
- Endpoint
  to [accept certificates on multiple ASAs](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cisco-security-cloud-control/accept-certificates-for-multiple-asa-devices/)
  into SCC Firewall Manager.
- Endpoint
  to [delete multiple users](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cisco-security-cloud-control/delete-multiple-users-from-security-cloud-control-firewall-manager-tenant/)
  on a tenant.

## Fixes

- Fixed regression that prevented searches on users by name working.
- Fixed performance issues when triggering deploys on FTDs managed by cdFMCs with large numbers of
  devices.
- Fixed performance issues when triggering upgrades on FTDs managed by cdFMCs with large numbers of
  devices.

# Version 1.10.0 (2025-04-01)

## Added

- The Cloud-delivered Firewall Management Center (cdFMC) API docs are now available as part of the
  Security Cloud Control Firewall Manager API documentation.
  See [here](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cisco-security-cloud-control/cdfmc-api-overview/) for
  more information.

## Improvements

- Improved the accuracy and quality of S2S VPN tunnel and RA VPN session information provided by the
  cdFMC health monitoring endpoint.

# Version 1.9.0 (2025-03-17)

## Added

- Endpoints to upgrade FTD devices

- Endpoint to fetch targets associated with an object

# Version 1.8.0 (2025-02-05)

## Improvements

- You can now access the Security Cloud Control Firewall APIs from
  `https://api.<your-region>.security.cisco.com/firewall`. The old URLs (
  `https://edge.<region>.cdo.cisco.com/api/rest` and
  `https://<region>.manage.security.cisco.com/api/rest` will continue to work).
- Support added to perform zero-touch provisioning of FTDs using cdFMC templates.

# Version 1.7.0 (2025-01-24)

## Added

- Endpoints to upgrade ASA devices.
- Endpoints to execute arbitrary API endpoints on an on-prem FMC.
- Endpoint to fetch the raw config of an ASA.

## Improvements

- MSSP tenant management:
    - When creating a SCC tenant, you can now optionally provide a sales order number.
- Get Devices endpoint:
    - Provide High Availability (HA) and Clustering information for on-prem FMC-managed FTDs. Note:
      Unlike with a cdFMC-managed FTD HA pair or cluster, each node of an on-prem FMC-managed FTD HA
      pairs and cluster is represented as a separate device record.
        - Note: Full HA and clustering information for on-prem FMC is currently gated behind a
          feature flag.
    - Add links from FMC-managed devices to the FMC, and access policies managed by the FMC.
    - Improve searchability of the endpoint by adding multiple new searchable fields.
- List VPN Sessions endpoint:
    - It is now possible to search VPN sessions by `loginTime` and `lastActiveTime`.

## Fixes

- Multiple fixes to correct the value of counts displayed in list endpoints.

## Deprecations

- The `uidOnFmc` field is deprecated and will be removed in v2 of the API. It has been supplanted by
  the `cdFmcInfo.deviceRecordOnFmc` and `onPremFmcInfo.deviceRecordOnFmc` fields, which contain
  additional information.
- The `deviceRole` field is deprecated and will be removed in v2 of the API. It has been supplanted
  by the `deviceRoles` field, which is a list and can represent the multiple roles a device can
  take.
