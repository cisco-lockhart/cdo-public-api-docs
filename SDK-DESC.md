# Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO) Python SDK
The CDO Python SDK facilitates automated interaction with the Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO) API, enabling developers to integrate Cisco's cloud-based security policy and device management into Python applications.

For more information and detailed documentation, visit the [CDO Python SDK documentation](https://github.com/cisco-lockhart/cdo-public-api-docs/tree/main/cdo-sdk/python).

Read more about CDO [here](https://docs.defenseorchestrator.com/).

## Installation
Install the CDO Python SDK package with the following command:
```
pip install cdo-sdk-python
```

## Getting Started
After installation, import the SDK into your Python project and configure your API credentials.

## Usage Example
```python
import cdo_sdk_python, os
from cdo_sdk_python.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters
configuration = cdo_sdk_python.Configuration(
    host="https://edge.staging.cdo.cisco.com/api/rest"
)

# Configure Bearer authorization (JWT)
configuration.access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]

with cdo_sdk_python.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = cdo_sdk_python.TenantManagementApi(api_client)

    try:
        api_response = api_instance.get_tenants()
        print("The response of TenantManagementApi->get_tenants:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling TenantManagementApi->get_tenants: %s\n" % e)
```
