# Postman Collection

Postman Collections are a way to group requests together for exploring an API and automating common tasks. They may be customized and shared as well.

To use the SCC Firewall Manager API using Postman:
- Download the [Cloud Firewall Manager Postman collection](https://github.com/cisco-lockhart/cdo-public-api-docs/blob/main/postman-collection.json), and import it into your Postman application.
- Download the [cdFMC Postman collection](https://github.com/cisco-lockhart/cdo-public-api-docs/blob/main/cdfmc-postman-collection.json), and import it into your Postman application.
- Additionally, we provide a [sample Postman environment](https://github.com/cisco-lockhart/cdo-public-api-docs/blob/main/postman-environment.json), which you can update with your API token and CDO region in order to get started.
